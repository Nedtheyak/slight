## Welcome
You've found a past project! This was done in a 4 month independently-directed learning environment. This meant that I had no formal direction for how to write the code, except to make it work, and make it "not atrocious." In other words, my newer education would likely lead me to write this in a much different style, but this was still a good learning experience. I am proud of what I was able to teach myself to create, even if I am not necessarily proud of all of the code.

As for why I don't rework the code now, the short story is that it's not worth my time and energy. I am learning new content, and while this was a good learning experience at the time, nowadays I would be better off working on a new project than attempting to clean up this one. I may yet come back to it, but I prefer to focus on one or two projects at a time â€“ and school is providing plenty to work on.

## Description
A game in Unity 3d similar to Tribes: Ascend, but more arcade-based.

Likely to stay singleplayer for a while, possibly forever.

Premise:
You have 100 seconds to shoot the red enemies. 1 enemy = 1 point.

Controls:
- WASD to move, Space to jump/jetpack
- Left mouse to shoot, R to reload
- Right mouse to swing your sword
- Shift to toggle skiing mode, F to begin grind on a rail
- Escape to unlock cursor, Backspace to restart

Tips:
- Click the lock cursor button at the top left. This keeps your cursor in the game window while you play.
- Taking the game out of fullscreen can reduce lag.
- Moving around is probably the best way to have fun in this game, so don't be afraid to go fast!
- Your shots create small explosions when they hit, so no need to be too accurate.
- Your sword is harder to use, but if you can kill a whole line of enemies it's pretty fun.
- Have fun, but it's a work in progress, so expect unpolished aspects.
