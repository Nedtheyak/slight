## Welcome
You've found a past project! This was done in a 4 month independently-directed learning environment. This meant that I had no formal direction for how to write the code, except to make it work, and make it "not atrocious." In other words, my newer education would likely lead me to write this in a much different style, but this was still a good learning experience. I am proud of what I was able to teach myself to create, even if I am not necessarily proud of all of the code.

As for why I don't rework the code now, the short story is that it's not worth my time and energy. I am learning new content, and while this was a good learning experience at the time, nowadays I would be better off working on a new project than attempting to clean up this one. I may yet come back to it, but I prefer to focus on one or two projects at a time â€“ and school is providing plenty to work on.

## Description
A game in Unity 3d similar to Tribes: Ascend, but more arcade-based.

Likely to stay singleplayer for a while, possibly forever.
